# A/B Testing: New York City Taxi Limousine Commission
This is a project useful for completing the course: Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of how to prepare, create, and analyze A/B tests. 
**A/B test results should aim to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.**

**Note** 
For the purpose of this project, let's assume that the sample data comes from an experiment in which customers are randomly selected and divided into two groups: 
1) customers who are required to pay with a credit card
2) customers who are required to pay with cash.

Without this assumption, we cannot draw causal conclusions about how payment method affects fare amount.

**The goal** is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python. **Discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash.**
